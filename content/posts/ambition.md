This is going to be a simple post dedicated to me writing. It is 4:24 AM, and I am in Terrassa Spain. 

What inspired me to write this was the documentary *the internets boy*. In fact, this .md file was created by this person. 

They were incredible but I think they lacked social skills which a lot of people who obsess over computers tend to lack. 

The documentary made me think of silicon valley. Silicon valley was born because of the researches and engineers that used to live in that Valley since they all worked for the government doing smart things. 

I need that crowd. 

I need to find my people who also like the things that I like and I need to surround myself with them if I want to create something that will change the world. 

I am scared to lose my morals, but I need to go to the bay area or a place to find my people. In the world of the infamous bay area where venture capitalist bug you to try to get a bite of your brilliant project while you are surrounded by millionares and billionares within kilometers of your location, it is hard to be normal and humble (something that is important to my morals).

If you surround yourself with these people, you will become obsessed with the riches and the power. A good example to point out this philosophy is the fact that you nor I have ever seen someone who was once winning more than 1,000,000,000 dollars a year and decided to leave it all to be a normal human (lets say 100,000 a year or the top 1 percent of the worldwide average salary).

ItÂ´s not that you become obsessed with money perhaps but rather an obsession with the comfort that 1,000,000,000 wealth can bring and the cost to maintain that same comfort that you have comes at the cost of never being able to reject anything less or you will be discomfortable again and you will have to live the life of a person with less than 1,000,000 in wealth. 

**Back to the reason I created this post.** My ambition is stronger than it has ever been and I am ready to complete any task I have for this year. Last year my goal was to finish university and I did it. Although, I could have had a more productive year, my parents would not have let me live if i did not get a university degree. In a way, I did it for them. 

This year I want to meet as many smart people as I can - and not only in tech. I want to meet the most interesting people and I can meet and surround myself with them. 

If I want to make the best change in the world, I cannot only listen to the people who like computers and take their advice always. I need to open my mind and here all parts of the world. 

I think this is a problem in silicon valley/bay area. They tend to only focus on the surface level of the problem and over complicate solutions without going to the root of the problem. 


An example I am going to make up to demonstrate the problem could be a silicon valley group of engineers decide to make an application to help people find a place to get a legal abortion (look at the date of the post... this is a real problem going on in the USA currently where woman cannot find places to get an abortion because of state laws or insufficient availability of a nearby abortion clinic). The real root of the problem is not that people cannot find a place to get an abortion. The real root of the problem is that people need to find a place to get an abortion. Why can't you find an abortion center on google maps like you can a pizza place. 


Silicon valley has its way of thinking and I think it is not representative. I think we need people and companies from different parts of the world creating technology. I think we need people and companies from different diverse background's creating technology. 

The more decentralized the power (tech) the better.

It would be in any country's best interest to have a silicon valley. To be the land where amazon, google, facebook, microsoft, apple, and tesla where made. 

If you think about it really hard, you realize that these companies could not have such power without the united states and the united states could not have such power without them. 


And if we open source advanced AI technology? Well then EU countries will ban it. 

And if we slow down on AI development? Well then china will catch up. 

When can't technology exist without any centralized power. 

This idea made me think of bitcoin and how perhaps the progressive idealistic people behind bitcoin may have come across this same idea while trying to disrupt centralized power- and perhaps that is how they thought of the a major disruption of centralized power: a decentralized currency.
