## Education

### High School

When I was 15, I took a university entrance exam (SAT) and scored very well for my age. I was encouraged to apply to universities. Since I had already completed the required number of high school classes for graduation, continuing high school further seemed pointless to me. Therefore, I finished my second year of high school and started university at the age of 16, and I also received full funding, making university education free for me!

One of my proudest achievements during my high school career was my involvement with Schoolhouse.world, a free online tutoring platform founded by Sal Khan, the founder of Khan Academy. I served as a founding member and tutor for the platform. Drew Bent, Co-founder of Schoolhouse.world, acknowledged my significant contribution by stating that I "played a pivotal role in developing the certification system."

### The University of Missouri

I had just turned 16, and I had reached the age to legally drive in the USA. A month later, I would be driving myself to university every day. Eventually, I got tired of driving every day and moved into a shared apartment in Columbia, MO - the city where my university was located. I felt very lonely having to leave my parents at such a young age, but I had so much freedom, and I was able to do whatever I wanted. I could go to the gym whenever I wanted, eat whatever I wanted, and do whatever I wanted. I even got a cat and could have friends over whenever. It was a great experience that I got to have at such a young age.

I was living by myself, but my hometown wasn't too far away. I would go back home every weekend to visit my parents, my girlfriend, and my friends. I even got to attend Prom - an event typically reserved for high school upperclassmen. Since I left high school early, I thought I had missed out on this experience.

I really loved the time I spent at university. I met some amazing people and got to briefly live the "university experience" at the age of 16. It was strange when I would tell people my age. One of my friends asked me to show my driver's license because they didn't believe me. Eventually, my friends got used to the age gap and accepted me.

During my time at university, I met my girlfriend, Angela. She was studying in my hometown at the local high school for a year as a foreign exchange student from Spain. I met her through mutual high school friends, and we became friends and eventually partners. She would tell me stories about her country and how they live in Spain, and I got jealous but also curious - I wanted to experience other cultures and countries too. Eventually, this curiosity turned into a goal that one day I would leave the USA for a year, just like she did.

I initially pursued mechanical engineering, but I realized that my desire for lifelong continuous learning would be better satisfied by studying computer science, considering how rapidly the field evolves. Although I didn't complete my mechanical engineering degree, I did manage to finish all of my general education requirements, which proved helpful when transferring these credits to my new university. Additionally, I became proficient in AutoCAD and SOLIDWORKS during my mechanical engineering studies, even obtaining the SOLIDWORKS Associateâ€“Mechanical Design Certificate!

### Western Governors University

I believe that transferring to WGU (Western  Governors University) was one of the best decisions I have ever made. It was an online university, which meant I could complete the degree whenever and wherever I wanted. Knowing this, I decided to move to Spain.

My girlfriend's mother was willing to sponsor my visa, and I was able to stay in Spain with my girlfriend while pursuing a degree that I loved; with all of these opportunities, how could I not have moved to Spain?  I was also in Europe, so I took advantage of this and decided to travel.

There was a problem though. Unlike my last university, I would have to pay for this one. Thankfully, my parents payed for it, but I didn't want to be a financial burder to them and make them pay for it for long - I had to finish the whole degree in one year so that my parents would not have to pay for another year. I managed to finish the university in one year. It was a tremendous amount of work to finish all of the courses and to obtain all of the certifications in one year, but I was barely able to finish before the academic year would have ended.

The nice thing about the university is that it allowed me to obtain certifications for free! Since they were free, I obtained them all.
