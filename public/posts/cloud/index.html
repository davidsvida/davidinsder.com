Cloud native applications are applications that are built and designed to leverage cloud computing frameworks. They are developed with modern methodologies to provide flexibility, efficiency, and robustness in the cloud environment. These applications are rapidly becoming the new normal in the world of software development due to their numerous advantages.\nKey Features of Cloud Native Applications Microservices Architecture: This allows developers to break down applications into smaller, manageable services that can function independently.\nContainerization: Cloud native applications often use containers for deployment. Containers bundle up the code and its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.\nContinuous Delivery: Cloud native applications support the principles of continuous integration and continuous delivery, making it easier to adapt to changes.\nScalability: These applications can automatically scale up and down depending on the need, thus optimizing resources and reducing costs.\nResiliency: Cloud native applications are designed to anticipate failure. They can quickly recover from any failure, ensuring a higher level of service availability.\nFAQs What is the difference between cloud-based and cloud-native applications?\nCloud-based applications are only hosted on a cloud infrastructure. However, cloud-native applications are not only hosted on the cloud but also specifically designed to leverage the cloud’s unique properties.\nWhy should my business consider moving to cloud-native applications?\nCloud-native applications provide numerous benefits such as faster time to market, improved scalability, and reduced operational costs. These attributes make them an excellent choice for businesses looking to stay competitive in today’s digital landscape.\nWhat skills are needed to develop cloud-native applications?\nDevelopers need a strong understanding of cloud computing concepts, experience with microservices architecture, knowledge of container technologies like Docker and Kubernetes, and familiarity with DevOps practices.\nWhat skills are the most valuable for cloud computing\nMy answer the this questions would be Cloud-native development - since more and more applications are being developed specifically for the cloud, cloud engineers will need to have a deep understanding of cloud-native development frameworks and tools, such as Kubernetes, Docker, and serverless computing.\nWhen and when not to use FaaS Faas is great because it can save you money as you dont have to always have your servers turned on, but at the same time there are times when you need a persistent state that these functions are not meant to be good with.\nFirst lets look at what exactly is FaaS\nFunction-as-a-Service (FaaS) is a specific kind of cloud service that lets you run individual functions or blocks of code in response to events, such as HTTP requests or file changes. These functions are typically small, focused tasks like processing an image, handling an API request, or reacting to a database change. You don’t manage any servers; you just deploy your function, and the cloud provider takes care of running it when triggered.\nExamples of FaaS: AWS Lambda Azure Functions Google Cloud Functions\nWhy Use FaaS? Simplicity: You focus solely on your code and don’t worry about infrastructure. Cost-Efficiency: You pay only for the compute time your function takes. Scalability: Automatically scales with the number of requests.\nA persistent environment or always-on infrastructure is needed when you have services that need to be continuously running and can’t be initiated or terminated on-demand. This contrasts with FaaS where functions are stateless, short-lived, and initiated based on events.\nWhy Do You Need a Persistent Environment?\nStateful Applications: Some applications need to maintain state between different sessions or operations, which might require databases or caching services that are always online. Low Latency: Always-on services can offer quicker response times compared to event-driven, serverless functions, which may need to “warm up.” Resource-Intensive Operations: Long-running data computations, batch processing, or real-time streaming can’t be easily broken down into short-lived, stateless tasks. Complex Networking: Applications with intricate networking rules or those needing a VPN, private network, or dedicated IP often require always-on infrastructure.\nWhen to Use and When Not to Use FaaS Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is a cost-efficient and scalable solution for executing specific tasks or functions in a cloud-based environment. While it offers various advantages, it’s essential to understand its limitations, especially when it comes to persistent state requirements.\nWhat Exactly is FaaS? FaaS, short for Function-as-a-Service, is a category of cloud computing services that allows you to run functions in response to specified events. These triggers could range from HTTP requests to changes in a database. The function usually perform highly focused tasks such as image processing, API request handling, or database modifications. The beauty of FaaS lies in its serverless architecture—you deploy your function, and the cloud provider takes responsibility for its execution when triggered.\nExamples of FaaS Providers: AWS Lambda Azure Functions Google Cloud Functions The Need for a Persistent Environment FaaS is not suitable for all use cases though (for example. situations that may require an always-on infrastructure). Below are some scenarios where a persistent environment is more appropriate:\nStateful Applications: Applications that must maintain state between different user sessions or operations often rely on databases or caching services that need to remain online continuously.\nLow Latency Requirements: Always-on services can deliver faster response times, avoiding the “warm-up” time sometimes needed by serverless functions.\nResource-Intensive Operations: Tasks involving long data processing, batch jobs, or streaming are challenging to put into a into short-lived, stateless functions.\nComplex Networking: If your application requires specialized networking configurations, such as a VPN, a private network, or a dedicated IP, a persistent environment is more suitable.\n","wordCount":"955","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-04-30T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-04-30T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://davidinsider.com/posts/cloud/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"David","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://davidinsider.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://davidinsider.com/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)">Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://davidinsider.com/about-me/about-me title="About Me"><span>About Me</span></a></li><li><a href=https://davidinsider.com/search title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://davidinsider.com/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://davidinsider.com/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Cloud Computing</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-04-30 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>April 30, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;955 words</div></header><div class=post-content><h2 id=what-is-cloud-computing>What is cloud computing<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-is-cloud-computing>#</a></h2><p>Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services over the internet, including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/i9x0UO8MY0g style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><hr><h2 id=cloud-computing-models>Cloud Computing Models<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#cloud-computing-models>#</a></h2><ul><li>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</li><li>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</li><li>Software as a Service (SaaS</li><li>Function as a Service (FaaS)</li></ul><hr><h2 id=what-are-cloud-native-applications>What are Cloud Native Applications?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-are-cloud-native-applications>#</a></h2><p>Cloud native applications are applications that are built and designed to leverage cloud computing frameworks.
